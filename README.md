# Image-Character-recognition-captcha
In this project i built a GUI which will show the image and the user has to input the characters shown in image , this works similar to an image captcha.
Here i took a random 6 digit/character string and with the help of image captcha library the string was converted into an image with the same characters . 
and thus the input is then checked with random string. I have also added audio captcha button in this so that it would be helpful for disabled people as well but i have some errors in the audio captcha as its opening in new window so its not taking input from user and giving blank output , so if any of you can debug this would be miuch helpfull! And the GUI was done with the help of tkinter.
